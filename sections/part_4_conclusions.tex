\subsection{Short-term $|$ Marketing + pricing}
Due to the nature of the situation explored in this report, our first and most important recommendation is to focus on marketing. This solution does not demand any organisational restructuring and thus can be implemented promptly.

\noindent By focusing on marketing, Howdy can attract new customers and increase the profitability of the company. Moreover, it was identified that relying on the health care providers for advertisement has not been efficient and has only served to decrease their profit margins. Howdy has the backing and the statistics from their current customers available, which can be used to advertise and push their product. Marketing was identified as a opportunity in the SWOT analysis and should be implemented at the strategic level by the sales director.

\noindent The second short-term solution that is recommended is to improve the way the pricing system is organised. Similarly to the previously discussed solution, it does not require any organizational restructuring and can be implemented along the other solutions. The solution that we described does not change the cost for the current clients, it just aims to clear up any confusion and make the future clients more secure in their purchase and what exactly they are paying for. This can be easily implemented at the strategic level of Howdy. 


\subsection{Long-term $|$ Organisational restructuring}

The previous section has presented what aspects Howdy could work on in the short-term. Here we will be discussing solutions regarding Howdys' organizational structure problems, including what departments that should be expanded and where in-sourcing should be considered. 

\noindent The developing department is continuously interrupted, and is not able to execute strategy meetings, since the maintenance department is regularly asking for support. Moreover, the cost of external psychological support is cutting profit margins while not helping the company in gaining more customers.

\noindent First of all, by hiring new staff in the maintenance department, it is possible to avoid possible interference with the devolving department. Before implementing this solution Howdy should first asses the maintenance workload as hiring unnecessary people would only increase the companies cost without any gains.


\noindent Secondly, during one of the CEO´s interviews, he declared that it would be cheaper to in-source the psychological support, but some considerations have to be mentioned first. Having an external support team offers a lot of flexibility, especially when the demand is not high, but since Howdy is aiming to scale up their business and on-board more customers, in the long run it will be a good idea to invest in having their own psychologists. 

\noindent The organizational restructuring can be either strategical or tactical depending on who in the company has the power to apply the changes. If only the CEO can hire and distribute the resources within the company then it's on a strategic level, otherwise it's on a tactical level. 
 

% \noindent\textbf{No recourses to hire} $|$ In this case that our assumptions are no longer true, so the company does not have the resources to hire people, temporary solutions can be adopted. First, some of the developing employees could be transferred in the maintenance and just the needed will be kept in the department. Furthermore, when the workload is low, the skilled employees, previously transferred to the maintenance department, could help in the developing department. This kind of solution can take place just for a short period since the developing department is the key to being competitive in the market, so essential and unreplaceable. In the matter of insourcing the psychologist support, it is a department that Howdy must own. Once the first psychologist is hired, and she/he will take some of the workloads that before was given to the external support and the results will be seen soon, without further investments. So, it is an investment that founds itself.


\subsection{Conclusion}
After using several models to analyse Howdy as a company, their business and the market that they operate in, the key problem and multiple sub problems have been identified. Using the root cause analysis relations between the problems were presented and the causes of the problems found. Throughout part 3 different solutions to each of the causes were presented and advantages and disadvantages of each were discussed. In the end short-term and long-term changes were suggested for the company. In the short-term they should rework their pricing model to make it easier on the customer and shift the focus of their channels to market and sell directly to customers themselves instead of through partners. In the long-term Howdy could have a focus on expanding the sales team to increase sales, expanding the maintenance team to keep up with the workload and hiring psychologists when needed instead of outsourcing the work.

\subsection{Robustness check}

To analyze our assumptions and to what extend our solutions and recommendations will change if the assumptions do not hold we did the following robustness check:

\noindent \textbf{Howdy does not have the resources to hire new people} $|$ If expanding is not possible Howdy can make an organizational restructuring. This may slow down the development as discussed in part 3, but the constant activity of the organization is more significant.

\noindent \textbf{The bonus plan for the sales department is not adequate} $|$ If the bonus that Howdy currently have implemented is not adequate, they will need to add a better reward system to further increase sales performance. This should be part of the short-term solution since it does not require organizational changes and it will be easy to implement.

\noindent \textbf{Howdy has been marketing sufficiently} $|$ Even though Howdy is already marketing their product we believe Howdy has been going through the wrong channels so our solution could still improve sales and benefit the company.
