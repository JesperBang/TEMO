\subsection{Reworking the marketing strategy - Nipun}

Marketing strategy is a long-term, forward-looking approach with the fundamental goal of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage.By analyzing the Star Model ,Business Canvas Model and Porters generic strategies we found some problems which could be improved by changing the current marketing strategy of HOWDY , which may lead the customers to on-board HOWDY to a greater extend.

\noindent Analyzing all the information which are given to us, we made some assumptions on which we studied and structured some solutions which are given bellow:

\noindent \textbf{Establish an Effective sales and Marketing team}  $|$ According to the results from the previously sections, it has been already identified that the company’s current sales team is inefficient and from the company presentation it was revealed that daily tasks intervene with strategy meetings. This may lead to why the company is losing money from the past years. So HOWDY can establish a strong sales and marketing team by recruiting some efficient personnel who will continuously monitor the sales progress and implement the correct and fruitful marketing strategy for the betterment of the organization. A strong Sales and Marketing team is responsible for researching and developing marketing opportunities and planning and implementing new sales plans. The Sales and Marketing Manager will also manage both the marketing and the sales staff and will perform managerial duties to meet the company's operations goals.

\noindent \textbf{Put more efforts in advertising HOWDY} $|$ From analyzing previous data we can see that Howdy is advertising their product in a limited way through their partners. But it is a clear threat to their profit margin. The more they advertise HOWDY the more they will get benefit. As they have limitations in advertising through their partner’s they can find some other ways to advertise their products.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use LinkedIn the right way $|$ As HOWDY is a B2B IT based organization, keeping a connection in LinkedIn will let them to be connected with other Business organizations as a lot of IT professionals, whose main target of B2B IT companies, are active on LinkedIn. HOWDY can reach a large audience by introducing a strong profile of their business through LinkedIn.
    \item Use Email Marketing $|$ Email marketing is still a very effective marketing tactic with a relatively low cost and high ROI. Through Email marketing HOWDY can educate it’s audience about the products or services it can also invite the audience to attend offline events or webinars.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Introduce free Workshops and Webinars} $|$ People love new learning experiences HOWDY can introduce some workshops or webinars related to it’s products or services. And many business organizations may get attracted to onboarding HOWDY for the wellbeing of their employee’s.

\noindent \textbf{Analyze the Data and Survey} $|$ To fix HOWDYs nonproductive marketing efforts, they must first identify the problem areas. Utilize an analytical tool to determine the aspects of their strategy that aren’t working and show which marketing channels are bringing in the bulk of traffic and which aren’t. They may also implement surveys to see how customers are finding their business. Once they have this information, you can use it to their advantage
 
\subsection{Organisational restructuring - Kasper}
In order for Howdy to divert from their current path and grow their business a change in the organizational structure will benefit them greatly.

\noindent As mentioned in the previous section the marketing and sales of the company would improve by expanding the sales team.

\noindent Howdy also has the problem of the development being interrupted by day-to-day tasks like maintenance. As the development is of significant importance it would benefit Howdy to address this problem.\\
\noindent One way of doing this is by expanding the maintenance team until the workload does not surpass the resources of the team.\\
\noindent If expanding the team is not possible then another option could be to assign someone working with development to the maintenance team. This will slow the development but the continuous operation of the company is more important and then the rest of the developers will be able to completely focus on their tasks. As the workload of the maintenance might change every day the people previously from development can support the developers when the workload is small.

\noindent Even though the cost of Howdys´ product is not identified as a problem in the retrospective analysis it could still increase resources for solutions to the problems presented in this document or other activities. One of the significant costs for Howdy is the external psychologists they hire as part of their product. It is not known what the workload for this task is but hiring their own psychologists could reduce costs as an internal psychologist costs 50\% of what an external one does.

\subsection{Reworking the pricing system - Jesper}
The perfect pricing system shares information to the customer to help them decide which product to chose. A pricing table must share the right amount of information without sharing too much as this often will result in chaotic pricing tables. Our proposed pricing table solution for Howdy can be seen on figure [\ref{pricingtable}] below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.72]{figures/pricing_Howdy.png}
\caption{Howdys´ new pricing table}
\label{pricingtable}
\end{figure}

\noindent In the old pricing table Howdy also had important information hidden as small text in lesser visual areas, an example would be in the top left corner where it says per license \cite[p.30]{oneofthepresentations}. Furthermore Howdy also chose to put the cost per call in small text under the module names making it hard for customers to initially see the actual price. 

\noindent The new pricing table is way less chaotic and some of the reason for this is that we included Howdy Basic, which is the mandatory it-system, in all the packages as Howdy cannot be used without. The inclusion of Howdy Basic in reflected in the price and visually shown with a Howdy blue colored check mark. The necessary information and cost estimate is now more clear for the customer and will be less intimidating.


\noindent Howdy currently has discount for mass purchases as can be seen when buying points for calls. At the moment our proposed pricing table solution states a price for Howdy Response Team but it might as well display the point cost as the current price is calculated based on the large point package. By keeping points instead of static numbers for the cost of Response Team calls, Howdy will still be able to offer discount on mass purchases. Furthermore Howdy should also consider offering discounts for mass purchases of their licenses, making it more attractive for larger companies to include all their employees when on-boarding a Howdy product. 

\subsection{Solution matrix - Amalia}

In order to asses the usefulness of each of our proposed solutions, we have created a solution matrix, attached in figure \ref{fig:solution}.Our proposed solution are mostly aimed at solving the inefficient marketing strategy, as this will be the fastest way of putting Howdy back on track in regards to earning a profit.
