Worklife Barometer ApS is a Danish Startup Established in 2014, born with the purpose of preventing sick leaves,by adopting a validated questionnaire for the identification of wellbeing. Its strategy is based on interposing itself between the companies and their employees so to guarantee a more fluid dialog on personal matters.     
In order to reach this achievement, it proposes three kind of products regarding different wellbeing aspects: Howdy wellbeing, Howdy body and Howdy feedback.\cite{howdywebsite}

\noindent Howdy Wellbeing is based on a schema of 5 questions, asked to the employees 2 times a month.
Furthermore, it gives, in real time, an overview of their status, underlining the first symptoms of sickness.
When a sign of stress is detected, Howdy proceeds by making a psychologist calling the stress employee in order to guide and offer assistance. With the purpose of avoiding the worsening of the situation.

\noindent Often companies do not have the right recourses, or they do not the better approach to organize annual employees’ surveys. For this reason, Howdy offers Howdy feedback,[4] to give the chance to collect employees’ opinions anytime it is felt necessary by the company.

\noindent Currently, its team is composed of more than 10 employees skilled in IT, sales, marketing and product development and supported by external professionals (psychiatrists and physiotherapists). Worklife Barometer ApS is boasting 14000 users spared on approx. 70 companies, (such as Simens, Skat, Scania, Orsted and Københavns commune) between Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Its goal is to reach new customers and to expand in new countries in the next years.\cite{howdywebsite}. Thanks to its activity, it helped to prevent 1.6\% sick leaves and 12\% of the users claimed that it has led them to talk to their manager about wellbeing-problems. \cite{howdywebsite}  

\noindent Even though Howdy is gathering positive feedback from its customers, it observed that they have not managed to on-board enough customers and is currently losing money.In the following report, Howdy will be analyzed in order to detect the reasons why.

\noindent In particular it has been asked to focus on GTM (go-to-make) strategy, especially on pricing strategy, and to identify the right team (in terms of roles) that will bring the company to a further step.\cite[s.39]{oneofthepresentations}

\noindent In this report, business models will be adopted with the aim to look at Howdy from different perspectives, so to draw a wider and completed picture of the company.  Thereby, there will be an inspection through all the company´s levels in order to point out at the possible improvements. This study will start with the identification of key problem and to problem owner, as given by the company, which are:


\begin{itemize}
  \item key problem : HOWDY is not successfully getting new clients and scaling the business\cite[s.38]{oneofthepresentations}
  \item problem owner: Rasmus Hartung (CEO)\cite[s.5]{oneofthepresentations}
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Assumptions - Kazi}

In our analysis and when building up our solution, we made a couple of assumption:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Howdy has the resources to hire new people 
    \item The bonus plan for the sales department is adequate 
    \item Howdy has not being marketing sufficiently 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent As Howdy has resources to hire new people they are planning to extend the sells team.

\noindent Howdy has a bonus plan for the future sells team so we believe it will motivate the sells team to sell Howdy’s product in a greater extent.

\noindent Howdy’s marketing focused on end corporations or pension companies both but pension companies run their own campaign where Howdy is not allowed to participate. So they are pretty much dependent on pension companies which is not enough to get more customer onboard. We acknowledge a much larger campaign and negotiation with pension companies with promoting Howdy’s product can develop the marketing strategy.
